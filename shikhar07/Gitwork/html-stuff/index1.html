                        He came, he saw, he conquered. These words are the very least one can associate with <strong>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</strong> for his performance thus far in international cricket. By placing the ball behind the square through to the third man boundary for a single, he recently achieved the milestone of making 10,000 ODI runs.
                        On July 14, 2018 at Lord’s, the home of cricket, he became only the 12th batsman in the history of ODI cricket to achieve this rare feat.<br>

                            Dhoni’s first real test as captain was the inaugural World T20 event in which he succeeded as a champion. It is still a tragic memory for me as a Pakistani fan, with Misbahul Haq’s last ball ‘mis-hit’ costing us a final we could have easily won otherwise. However, that was the moment I became Dhoni’s ardent admirer. He led the young side well and his strategic decisions as captain (who can forget the bowl-out rule where he used non-regular bowlers to hit the stumps and won that game) throughout the tournament made him even more special to his fans.
